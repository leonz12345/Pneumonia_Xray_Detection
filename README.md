# Pneumonia X-ray Detection

## About
In this project, I built robust convolutional neural networks to detect patients with pneumonia disease with over 85% test accuracy from X-ray images using Tensor-flow.

The significant of this project is to help doctors to quickly and accurately diagnose patients with pneumonia, which is a common symptom of COVID-19. To cI hope to build a user friendly interface to give more people access to this disease detection tool.

Finally, we used time-series forecasting to predict how a country would perform in the foreseeable future. Our model shows increases in Population Density, Death Rate, New Deaths Per Million, Stringency Index, and Hospital Beds Per Thousand will decrease the overall EDI. The findings match our expectation because of the increase of death rate, stringency index, new death counts, and hospital beds indicate the increase of severity for COVID-19. Moreover, we used the United States to demonstrate how our findings could be used to predict the EDI economic indicator. The same approach could be applied to other countries/cities with appropriately processed data. Finally, we made recommendations to countries facing the devastating long-term economic implications of this pandemic.

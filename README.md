# Pneumonia X-ray Detection

## About
In this project, I built robust convolutional neural networks to detect patients with pneumonia disease with over 87% test accuracy from X-ray images using Tensor-flow.

The significance of this project is to help doctors quickly and accurately diagnose patients with pneumonia, which is a common symptom of COVID-19. To make it convenient for more people to use, I built a user-friendly interface to give more people access to this disease detection tool. With a simple click of the upload button, one could get the prediction result in just a few seconds.
